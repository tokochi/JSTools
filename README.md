## About this Project

In the world of web development, there are countless instructions, code snippets, and configuration files to keep track of. To simplify this process, I decided to create a tool app that would allow me to store all of this information in one organized place. While I typically use Microsoft OneNote for taking notes, articles, and long-form explanations, this app is designed specifically to save time and eliminate the need to search for documentation for each technology. With this app, I can simply copy and paste the relevant code snippets and configurations, ensuring that I always have quick and easy access to the information I need to build successful web applications

## Installers

## Some technical information


The structure of the project was based on this amazing plugin [electron-vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-vite) , that helped me with the initial structure of the project, and a faster Electron Dev environement.


With some changes, was possible to make the Project more clear, separating the modules of front-end from the back-end, what also made the process of perform the build process more easier.
